User guide on API for front-to-start database
As specified in the project Performance Anomaly Detection, the data can be loaded from CSV files. We need an API to create communication between the front-end and back-end TimescaleDB. Our API will be generated using Flask and the csv module. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python (Wikipedia free encylopedia, 2024) 

a. Creating API

1. Import Python libraries
from flask import Flask, jsonify 
import csv

2.  Create the CSV file reader and Api to return data.
Note that the front-end loads data from the CSV file to create rows in the database.

3. Front sends requests to the database via the created API and the response comes in json format.

b. Inputs
Front end will laod csv file and displayed them as raw data.

c. Output
Output will be displayed in json format.
